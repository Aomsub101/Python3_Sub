# Python3 - Aomsub (Sub)
You will see my note/work in this git repository. :

Our shorterm goal - Putting together between computer graphic and networking.

## Day 1
- I learn some basic principle in coding like, DRY (Don't repeat yourself).
- I also learn about pygame to build a flying circle program.

## Day 2
- I learn SRP(single responsibility principle).
- Using random function to add more functionality to the circle class.
- Using physics to work with collisions of multiple circles.
- Learn about python socket

## Day 3
- I learn more in-depth about socket.
- I did make client and server can communicate to each other.
- I learn about parallel programming using thread library in python.
- with thread, I try to implement that with socket-based chat to make it more real-time.

## Day 4
- Today, we mainly discuss about multiple users chat.
- We also assign a group project for exercises that use pygame and socket to work together.

## Day 5
- I didn't join the class today.

## Day 6
- I learn about multi-processing today.

## Day 7
- I learn about plotting graph using pygame.

## Day 8
- I learn about virtual environment, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Day 9
- I learn about different way of plotting in matplolib.

## Day 10
- I learn about K-means algorithm
- I learn about API
